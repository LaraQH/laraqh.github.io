Hi, I am Daniel.  

I obtained a PhD in Atmospheric and Climate Science at [ETH Zurich](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-dynamics.html) in May 2019.   
The focus of my research was on atmospheric and climate dynamics, aimed at analysing physical processes governing the large-scale circulation and high-impact weather phenomena such as atmospheric blocking and windstorms.  

You can find some of my current projects here: [https://github.com/steidani](https://github.com/steidani)

I am currently working as a NatCat Risk Modeler for a Swiss insurance company.
