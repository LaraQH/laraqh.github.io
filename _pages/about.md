Hi, I am Carlos.  

Recently I did a MSc in Meteorology at [University of Barcelona] (http://www.ub.edu/estudis/ca/mastersuniversitaris/meteorologia/presentacio) and currently I am studying a MSc in Geographic Information Science and Remote Sensing at University of Zaragoza (https://estudios.unizar.es/estudio/ver?id=608).

The focus of my research was on severe convective storms (SCS) in Spain, specially supercells storms, aimed at analysing climatological and physical processes that favor their formation such as convective environments or the influence of synoptic patterns. 

You can find some of my current projects here: [https://github.com/ccalvosa](https://github.com/ccalvosa)
